# HFile v1 implementation in Go

_Code is mostly taken from Foursquare's [Quiver](http://github.com/foursquare/quiver) project, with the following modifications:_

1. _Extracted into another repository to reduce the amount of dependencies_
2. _Allow reading HFile from any `io.Reader`, so no longer limited to an OS file._
---

HFile is a KV file format (borrowed from HBase, based on SSTables) used at foursquare as the storage format for our distributed KV store [quiver](http://github.com/foursquare/quiver).

HFiles are designed to be simultaneously a) easily to generate incrementally (metadata is flushed at the end) and b) easy to serve / search as-is (thanks to an index), making them friendly to pipelines that regenerate large datasets and need to bulk-load them into production regularly.

# Summary of HFile format

On-disk, an HFile consists of:
  
  - some number of blocks,
  - an index, specifying the offset and length of each block along with its first key
  - a fixed-size, fixed-layout trailer of metadata

Each block contains some number of key-value pairs, each in the form of two 4-byte sizes `i` and `j`, followed by `i` bytes of key and `j` bytes of value.

# Finding data in an Hfile

Callers likely want to construct a `Reader` per file, and a `Scanner` per request.

Scanners are stateful (see below) and are *not* threadsafe.

## Reader

Readers read the trailer to find the index and load the index into memory. When a specific block's data is requested, the reader uses the index's offsets to find its data, decompresses it if needed and returns it.

## Scanner
A scanner looks up a key by binary searching the reader's block index, comparing the `firstKey` until it finds the last block with a starting key less than or equal to the requested key. It then iterates through the key-value pairs of the block until it finds a matching key, or returns nothing if it finds a greater key or the end of the block.

## Sorting requested keys
Scanners keep a reference to the most-recently loaded block, and their position within said block. Subsequent lookups only binary search the remaining blocks, and, when searching the current block, only search forward from the current position. This saves substantial repeated searching, but requires that keys be looked up in ascending order.

Scanners can be `Reset()` to return to their initial state.

Scanners keep track of the last key they looked up, and will error if a smaller key is requested.

# Writer
Writers support creating an hfile by repeatedly passing key-value pairs to `Write(k,v)`, in ascending order by key, before calling `Close()` to flush the index and metadata.

Writers buffer written k-v pairs until they reach `blockSize`, after which the next new key written will flush the block (optionally compressed) to the underlying storage and start a new one. NB: Since all k-v pairs for a given key must appear in the same block, emiting too many values for the same key, or very large values, can cause blocks to grow well beyond `blockSize`.


`NewWriter` wraps any `io.WriteCloser`. `NewLocalWriter` provides a helper that uses a local file at supplied path.
